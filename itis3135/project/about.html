                The <strong>GEMINI ANGELS</strong> band was founded by three best college bestfriends namely, Jessica,
                Dom and Bailey. Their love for music brought them together when they enrolled in a music class in their
                sophomore year of college.

                <h3>The Story</h3>
                <div>

                    <p><strong>Jessica, Dominique (Dom), and Bailey</strong> first met in 2017 when they crossed paths
                        at the University
                        of South Carolina — Upstate in Spartanburg, SC. Jessica and Bailey were roommates on campus at
                        USC Upstate, then they met Dom, who was their Resident Assistant (RA) for the year. They clicked
                        instantly and ever since then, they have been the best of friends. </p>
                    <p>Soon after they met, they began to bond over music and contemplated the idea of starting a band
                        together. They value women’s empowerment, so they wanted to make music that would inspire and
                        impact girls of all ages. So…they did just that. </p>

                <h3>Band name Meaning</h3>
                <div>


                    <p>As their fanbase has grown over the years, they have gotten many questions regarding the name of
                        their band. So, why “Gemini Angels?” All three of them were born in early June, which means
                        their zodiac signs are all gemini. They felt as though that similarity was unique, so they
                        decided to utilize that characteristic between them. Then…the “angels” part of their name was
                        just totally random!</p>
