                with no flow or repetition. Headers or Main Ideas have the same font size as their description making it harder to read through the page.</li>
            <li><b>R</b>epetition- There is no repetion of some elements as you go through the page. Each sections of the page has entirely different layouts.</li>
            <li><b>A</b>lignment- The alignments on this page is atrocious. Each section has a different margin and alignments which breaks the flow when reading the page.</li>
