        <ul>
            <li><b>C</b>ontrast- The contrast between colors on the page is as terrible as the contrast between texts. Colors are thrown everywhere 
                with no flow or repetition. Headers or Main Ideas have the same font size as their description making it harder to read through the page.</li>
            <li><b>R</b>epetition- There is no repetion of some elements as you go through the page. Each sections of the page has entirely different layouts.</li>
            <li><b>A</b>lignment- The alignments on this page is atrocious. Each section has a different margin and alignments which breaks the flow when reading the page.</li>
            <li><b>P</b>roximity- Elements that corelate to each other are not given the necessary groupings but instead, they are scattered everywhere on the page.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website breaks all the CRAP principles for designing and developing a good website.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>C</b>ontrast- The contrast on the website is of great quality. Colors of text and and background colors of elements have good contrast to make
            texts easy to read. The main ideas have they appropiate Header tags and their description or details have smaller font sizes than the parent.</li>
            <li><b>R</b>epetition- Repetition of elements(i.e header elements, footer elements, dividers etc) is persistent as you navigate from page to page</li>
            <li><b>A</b>lignment- Everything is centered in the middle and there is a good amount of whitespaces in between sections of the page</li>
            <li><b>P</b>roximity- Each section of each page has elements that corelate with each other. This is a good practice that gives readers all the necessary 
            information they need on a topic in just one section</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This website follows the CRAP principles to a good amount. This enhaces users or readers ability to read information on the page.</p>
