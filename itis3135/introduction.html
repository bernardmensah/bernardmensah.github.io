        <ul>
            <li>Personal background: I am originally from Ghana, West Africa. I moved to the USA in 2017 to live with my dad and also to go to college </li>
            <li>Professional: I have been working my first job for 4 years now and just recently landed an internship with Atlas Technologies and Automation for which I am very grateful for</li>
            <li>Academic background: I am currently a Junior computer science student working towards my Bachelors. I am concentrating in the field of Software Engineering and for that I do need a very good experience in Web Design and Development hence my reason for taking this course</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've been using computers since I was in college, and eventually ended up working on a computer store (including selling the software we teach in this class!) and getting a Masters in Management Information Systems. That doubled my salary in one year!</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: I have also used a Windows 7-10 at home and work to program thus far and hoping to learn the MAC side of things later on</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking this semester: 
                <ul>
                    <li>ITSC2600 - CS Program, Identity and Career - A seminar course to help me understand what it will take me to succeed in my career as a computer scientist</li>
                    <li>ITSC3130 - Human Centered Design - A vital part of computer science and software engineering which will help me in understand how we can use Technologies to make human and computer interactions easy and safer </li>
                    <li>ITIS3135 - Web Design & Development - I want to build on Web Development experience in general</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you by:
                I hiked to the top of Chimney rock only to feel nauseous and take a puke on the top of the rock</li>
            <li>I'd also like to share:
                I love web development because it makes you see how most website are built and how they function</li>
        </ul>
